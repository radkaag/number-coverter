# Number Converter

Implement a number to word list converter as a Node backend and React/Redux fronted.

## Getting started

Please follow instructions:

Clone repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/radkag/kiwi.git
```

Go to repository and install node dependencies for client and for server:

```
cd kiwi
yarn install
cd client/
yarn install
```

Run the server from `/kiwi` directory (use globally installed nodemon):

```
nodemon server.js
```

Now `Node` server is running, open another terminal, go to `/client` directory and run the client:

```
yarn start
```

## Cypress test

Run tests from `client` directory with command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```
